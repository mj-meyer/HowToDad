ðŸ”Ž **Tech I had to learn on this project**

- Nebular

This was the first time I used Nebular. Really enjoyed exploring a new UI library.

- @ngx-pwa/local-storage

This is a local storage like library for angular, except it interfaces with IndexDB. So it's asynchronous unlike localStorage

## Development server

Run `ng serve how-to-dad` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests or keep them running by `ng e2e --watch` via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).

Run `nx affected:e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.

## Understand your workspace

Run `nx dep-graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.
